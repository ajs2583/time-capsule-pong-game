# Time Capsule Pong Game (Python Turtle)

This is a simple 2-player Pong game implemented using Python's built-in `turtle` module. The game was originally created some time ago as part of a personal learning project and is being uploaded now as a time capsule — a snapshot of an earlier stage in my programming journey.

## Gameplay Overview

- Two players control paddles on the left and right sides of the screen.
- The left player uses the `W` and `S` keys to move their paddle up and down.
- The right player uses the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys.
- A point is awarded when the ball passes the opposing player’s paddle.
- The game keeps track of both players' scores and resets the ball after each point.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `turtle` module for graphics
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
